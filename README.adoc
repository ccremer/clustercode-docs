= Clustercode Documentation with Antora

== Build Documentation

. Edit the tags/versions to build the documention in `antora-playbook.yml`
. Run the build: `make docs-build`
. Run a local web server: `make docs-serve`
. Clean local files: `make docs-clean`

== Requirements

- node v12
- npm v6

== Patch Antora

Since we keep documentation in the same repo as code, we need to make some adjustments.
It's generally not possible in Antora 2.x to set the component version to the one defined in the `branches` in the playbook YAML file.

Thus, with the help of https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/-/merge_requests/580/diffs, there's a patched file that enables us this behaviour.

WARNING: It's a hack!

Create/update the patched file:

. Remove the `postinstall` script from `package.json`
. Install dependencies with `npm install`
. `cp node_modules/@antora/content-aggregator/lib/aggregate-content.js aggregate-content.js`
. Edit the file so it works with `ref` again (see https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/-/merge_requests/580/diffs[gitlab.com/antora/antora!580])
. Activate the `postinstall` script again in `package.json`

Now, when installing Antora, the patch should be applied automatically.
